Hammond 2022:

- The video shows a walkthrough of John Hammond using tools like Ghidra to complete a ctf challenge!

- In the video, John goes in depth on how the logic works behind the program and pairs the explenation
well with Ghidra. This video helped a ton on the next exercises!

## a) and b)
Ghidra up and running!

I renamed the function name from "main" to "pwordfetch" and the "iVar1" variable to "pwordcompare".
You can see the strcmp uses the pwordcompare variable in the to see that the input __doesn't__ match the password string. If the input __doesn't__ match the
pwordcompare value, the program returns "Yes! That\'s the password. FLAG{Tero-0e3bed0a89d8851da933c64fefad4ff2}" and if the input __does__ match the value, it means the password is false and
it returns "Sorry, no bonus.".

## c) 

To change the logic of the program, we must understand it. In the binary you can see that when the input is set to JNZ (not equal to zero) and the input is sala-hakkeri-321, the program presents you with the flag.
We need to reverse this so that the strcmp returns 0, when the password is anything but the correct one.

In order to change this, we change the JNZ (not equal) to JZ (equal), like so!

Here we see the program working :P
